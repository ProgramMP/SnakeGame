This project is a Snake Game developed using PIXI.JS and GSAP, fully compliant with the following six requirements:

The game features a landing screen that displays the leaderboard and includes a start button to initiate a new game.

The snake moves at a fixed speed along the x-axis, responding to the latest user input via arrow keys.

The snake grows by one unit each time it consumes an apple appearing on the screen.

Upon consuming 25 apples, the game advances to a second level, introducing an obstacle positioned in the center of the screen.

The game terminates if the snake collides with itself or any obstacles present in the scene.

Controls are provided to pause and resume the snakeâ€™s movement, allowing the player to freeze and continue the game as desired.
